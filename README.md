## Hi there 👋

I’m zim also known as matt, I current work with C++, C#, and HTML. Currently, I’m exploring UI design and security, with a goal of building sleek and secure applications. 🚀
I've worked with c++ for about 2 years now, HTML for about 6 months and I just dabble in c# every now and then.
My latest project was an obfuscator, a challenging yet rewarding journey into code security. 🔐
